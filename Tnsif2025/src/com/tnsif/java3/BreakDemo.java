		 terminate the execution of a loop or switch statement prematurely. 
		 When a break statement is encountered, the control immediately exits the 
		 loop or switch, and the program continues execution from the statement following 
		 the loop or switch.
		 Loop Control: In loops, break allows you to exit the loop based on a condition.
         Switch Control: In switch statements, it prevents the "fall-through" to other cases after a match is found.
         Efficiency: It can make code more efficient by stopping unnecessary execution.
